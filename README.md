# SQL Challenge - Employee Database

## Background
As a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, you've been tasked with researching the employees from the 1980s and 1990s. The only available data is stored in six CSV files.

In this project, you will be involved in three main tasks.

1. Data Modeling

2. Data Engineering

3. Data Analysis

### Data Modeling
Carefully analyze the contents of the CSV files, and then generate an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) that visually depicts the connections and associations between the different tables present in the files.

###  Data Engineering
I Create the table schemas and import the CSV files into their corresponding SQL tables.
I have provided the following details for each file:
-File name
-Columns present in the file
-Data types of each column
-Primary key(s) and their uniqueness
-Foreign key(s) and their references
-Any additional constraints or requirements for the table schema

### Data Analysis
After building the database, I have answered the following questions:
-List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

-List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

-List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

-List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

-List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

-List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

-List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

-List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
