# SQL Challenge - Employee Database

## Background
As a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, you've been tasked with researching the employees from the 1980s and 1990s. The only available data is stored in six CSV files.

In this project, you will be involved in three main tasks.

1. Data Modeling

2. Data Engineering

3. Data Analysis

### Data Modeling
Carefully analyze the contents of the CSV files, and then generate an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) that visually depicts the connections and associations between the different tables present in the files.
